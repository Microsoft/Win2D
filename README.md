# Win2D

Win2D is an easy-to-use Windows Runtime API for immediate mode 2D graphics 
rendering with GPU acceleration. It is available to C# and C++ developers writing 
Windows Store apps for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. It utilizes the power of 
Direct2D, and integrates seamlessly with XAML and ICoreWindow.

Win2D is work in progress and evolving rapidly. The goal of releasing this code 
in an early, incomplete state is to solicit early developer feedback.

## Code Example
To give you a flavor of what the code looks like, here is a snippet of XAML:
```xml
xmlns:canvas="using:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas"

<Grid>
    <canvas:CanvasControl x:Name="canvasControl" />
</Grid>
```
and C#:
```cs
canvasControl.Draw += canvasControl_Draw; 
```
```cs
void canvasControl_Draw(CanvasControl sender, CanvasDrawEventArgs args)
{
    args.DrawingSession.Clear(Colors.CornflowerBlue);
    args.DrawingSession.DrawEllipse(190, 125, 140, 40, Colors.Black, 6);
    args.DrawingSession.DrawText("Hello, world!", 100, 100, Colors.Yellow);
}
```



A working sample can be found in the Samples directory.

## Source Directory Structure

Note: For the bulk of interesting product code, go to /winrt/lib.

**/bin** - Binary files generated by the build

**/build** - Shared, build-related resources that are common across projects
- /Assets - Common Windows Store assets used for tests and samples
- /nuget - Resources needed for building the NuGet package

**/numerics** - Cross-platform vector and matrix math library. There are three implementations:
- /Cpp
- /DotNet
- /WinRT

**/obj** - Intermediate files generated by the build

**/samples** - Example projects showing how to use Win2D

**/tests** - Test projects that consume Win2D in a similar way to how an 
external customer would. Each one is a Windows Store app. These tests are run for manual 
verification.

**/tools** - Standalone utilities, separate from Win2D product code
- /codegen - Generates headers+IDL from XML resource files (you don't have to build this to build Win2D)
- /copyright - Verifies the right copyright banner appears at the top of each source file
- /docs - Tools and scripts for building API reference documentation

**/winrt** - Win2D product code and automated tests
- /dll - Build resources for the product dll
- /docsrc - Source files used to create the reference documentation
- /inc - Common includes
- /lib - All the projected IDL and runtime class implementations!
  - /WinRTDirectX - projections for D3D/DXGI types
- /published - Headers that are included directly in the NuGet package for 3rd part consumption
- /test.external - Automated tests that use only the public WinRT interface
- /test.internal - Automated tests that link directly with winrt.lib to access internals of the implementation
- /test.managed - Automated tests written in C#
- /test.nativecomponent - C++/CX component that exposes native functionality for use by test.managed
